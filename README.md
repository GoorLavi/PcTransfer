# PcTransfer - File transfer interface includes permissions that prohibit access to Windows Explorer
_Developed with Electron, React, Redux, Webpack_

I created this software allowing people to share information from their computer to others, without damaging the information or the computer itself.

The software displays contents of a shared folder and the user will be able to mark files and folders at will.

After the file selection is finished, the user will be required to choose external memory to copy the information to it.

To set the shared folder location go through `PcTransfer/app/consts.js`
and set `sharedFolderPath` to the path you want
